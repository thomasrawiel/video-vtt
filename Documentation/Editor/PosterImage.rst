Poster Image
===

For self-hosted videos, e.g. mp4 you can add a poster image that is added to the video.

You can set a poster image either in the video's metadata or in the file reference of the content element where the video is used.

.. tip::
   When referencing the same video in multiple places on your website, it is recommended to :ref:`add the poster image to the video's metadata <poster-image-metadata>`. This way, you only need to add it once.

   A :ref:`poster image in the file reference <poster-image-reference>` takes precedence over the metadata poster image.
   You can use that when you want to have different poster images for the same video.

.. _poster-image-metadata:

Add poster image in file metadata
---

Switch to the module :guilabel:`File > Filelist`.

Select the video where you want to add the poster image and edit the metadata of the file

.. figure:: ../Images/PosterImage/FilelistEditMetadata.jpg
   :class: with-shadow
   :alt: Edit video metadata
   :width: 600px

   Click the pencil button to edit the video's metadata


Switch to the :guilabel:`Video` tab and add or upload an image for the `Poster image` field

.. figure:: ../Images/PosterImage/FilelistEditMetadataDetail.jpg
   :class: with-shadow
   :alt: Switch to the video tab and add an image
   :width: 400px

   Add an existing or upload a new image file, that should be used as the video's poster image

.. figure:: ../Images/PosterImage/FilelistEditMetadataDone.jpg
   :class: with-shadow
   :alt: Image has been added

   When the image has been added, click `Save`

.. _poster-image-reference:
