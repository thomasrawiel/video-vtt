Installation
============

The extension needs to be installed as any other extension of TYPO3 CMS. Get the
extension by one of the following methods:

#. **Use composer**: Run

   .. code-block:: bash

      composer require traw/video-vtt

   in your TYPO3 installation.

#. **Get it from the Extension Manager:** Switch to the module :guilabel:`Admin Tools > Extensions`.
   Switch to :guilabel:`Get Extensions` and search for the extension key
   *video_vtt* and import the extension from the repository.

#. **Get it from typo3.org:** You can always get current version from `TER`_
   by downloading the zip version. Upload the file afterwards in the Extension
   Manager.

..  warning::
    TYPO3 strongly encourages users to use the :ref:`Composer-based installation instructions <ComposerInstall>`
    as the legacy method of installing TYPO3 is considered **out of date**.
