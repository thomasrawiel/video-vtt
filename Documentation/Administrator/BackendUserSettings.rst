Backend user settings
=============

Each setting that is described in the :ref:`Editors manual <user-manual>` is configured as an exclude field.

That means each field has to be specifically allowed for the editor user or user group.

Switch to the :guilabel:`Backend Users > Backend user groups` module

Edit the user group and switch to the `Access Rights` tab._backend


To add and change tracks and time-based data, the group must be allowed to list and modify the `File Metadata` table.

To add and change poster images as well as change the video controls, the group must be allowed to list and modify the `File Reference` table.
